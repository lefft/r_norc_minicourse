## welcome!

agenda for course:

- point 1
- point 2
- point ...

course materials are all on the course website: 

> [http://lefft.xyz/r_minicourse](http://lefft.xyz/r_minicourse)

each week we'll have slides, notes, and a script. little exercises will be interleaved throughout the notes. the best way to write up solutions is to start a new R script called (e.g.) `week1_exercises.r` and type directly into that.

there will also be a list of links to useful resources up on the site

## 2. Variables and Assignments

time to start writing code!

```{r}
# welcome to the R mini-course. in keeping with tradition...
print("...an obligatory 'hello, world!'")
```

## 

```{r}
# this line is a comment, so R will always ignore it.
# this is a comment too, since it also starts with "#".

# but the next one is a line of real R code, which does some arithmetic:
5 * 3

# we can do all kinds of familiar math operations:
5 * 3 + 1

# 'member "PEMDAS"?? applies here too -- compare the last line to this one:
5 * (3 + 1)
```



## 

```{r}
# usually when we do some math, we want to save the result for future use.
# we can do this by **assigning** a computation to a **variable**
firstvar <- 5 * (3 + 1)
```

```{r}
# now 'firstvar' is an **object**. we can see its value by printing it.
# sending `firstvar` to the interpreter is equivalent to `print(firstvar)`
firstvar
```


## 

```{r results='hold'}
# we can put basically anything into a variable, and we can call a variable
# pretty much whatever we want (but do avoid special characters besides "_")
myvar <- "boosh!"
myvar

myVar <- 5.5
myVar
```

```{r results='hold'}
# including other variables or computations involving them:
my_var <- myvar
my_var

myvar0 <- myVar / (myVar * 1.5)
myvar0
```


## 

```{r}
# when you introduce variables, they'll appear in the environment tab of the 
# top-right pane in R Studio. you can remove variables you're no longer
# using with `rm()`. (this isn't necessary, but it saves space in both 
# your brain and your computer's
rm(myvar)
rm(my_var)
rm(myVar)
rm(myvar0)
```


## 3. Vectors

```{r}
# R was designed with statistical applications in mind, so naturally there's
# lots of ways to represent collections or sequences of values (e.g. numbers).

# in R, a "vector" is the simplest list-like data structure.
# you can create a vector with the `c()` function (for "concatenate")
myvec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
myvec

anothervec <- c(4.5, 4.12, 1.0, 7.99)
anothervec


```


## 

```{r}
# vectors can hold elements of any type, but they must all be of the same type.
# to keep things straight in your head, maybe include the data type in the name
myvec_char <- c("a","b","c","d","e")
myvec_char

# if we try the following, R will coerce the numbers into characters:
myvec2 <- c("a","b","c",1,2,3)
myvec2
rm(myvec2)


```


## 

suppose the only reason we created `myvec` and `anothervec` was to put them together with some other stuff, and save that to `longvec`. in this case, we can just remove `myvec` and `anothervec`, and use `longvec`

```{r}
# you can put vectors or values together with `c()`
longvec <- c(0, myvec, 9, 80, anothervec, 0, NA)
```

```{r}
rm(myvec)
rm(anothervec)

longvec
```


## 

```{r}
# to see how many elements a vector has, get its `length()`
length(longvec)

# to see what the unique values are, use `unique()` (you'll get a vector back)
unique(longvec)

# a very common operation is to see how many unique values there are:
length(unique(longvec))


```


## 

```{r}
# to see a frequency table over a vector, use `table()`
table(longvec)

# note that this works for all kinds of vectors
table(c("a","b","c","b","b","b","a"))
table(c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE))
```


##

an important but not obvious thing:

> R has a special value called `NA`, which represents missing data.

by default, `table()` won't tell you about `NA`'s (annoying, ik!). so get in the habit of specifying the `useNA` **argument** of `table()`


```{r}
# note "DRY" principle (don't repeat yourself)
vec_with_NA <- c(1,2,3,2,2,NA,3,NA,NA,1,1)
table(vec_with_NA)
table(vec_with_NA, useNA="ifany") # or "always" or "no"
```



## 

notice that the structure of the last table command is:

> `table(VECTOR, useNA=CHARACTERSTRING)`

some terminology:

  - `table()` is a **function**
  
  - `table()` has **argument positions** for a vector and for a string
  
  - we provided `table()` with two **arguments**:
  
      * a vector (`vec_with_NA`)
      * a character string (`"ifany"`)
      
  - the second argument position was **named** `useNA`
  
  - we used the **argument binding** syntax `useNA="ifany"`


##

argument-binding is kind of like variable assignment, but `useNA` doesn't
become directly available for use after we give it a value.

this might feel kinda abstract, but i promise the intuition
will become clearer the further along we get. 

some arguments -- like `useNA`
here -- can be thought of as "options" of the function they belong to.


```{r}
# here's an example that might clarify the concept of argument binding:
round(3.141592653, digits=4)
```


## 

`round()` is a commonly used function that illustrates an important concept called **vectorization**.

many functions in R are vectorized by default, which means that they can take an individual value (like the `round()` call above), or they can take a vector of values. 

in the latter case, the function applies pointwise to each element of the vector, and returns a vector with the same length and order as the input:


```{r}
round(longvec, digits=4)

# if we don't tell it how many digits to round to, it defaults to 0
round(longvec)
```

> in fact MOST MATH STUFF IS VECTORIZED

## 4. Subsetting and Indexing

```{r}
# rep() and seq() and : and ...


# subsetting vectors (introduce via letters + LETTERS)

```



##

here's an analogy you should keep in mind:
think of vectors as columns of an abstract spreadsheet (**not** rows).

in fact, this is a bit more than an analogy in R.
R's implementation of a "spreadsheet" -- the **data frame** -- is quite
literally a list of vectors. the data frame is a beautiful data structure,
and is used to represent (flat) datasets e.g. from an excel sheet.

fun fact: python's most popular data analysis library borrows heavily from
R, most clearly with its very nice implementation of R's data frame structure.

we'll have a first look at data frames next



## 5. Data Frames!

a data frame is...

## 

```{r}
# there are several ways to create data frames, and here's one:
mydf <- data.frame(
  col1=c(1,2,3,4,5,6),
  col2=c("a","b","c","a","b","b")
)
mydf

# here's a handful of common functions you'll call on data frames, in order
# to visually inspect it or to refer to some property it has:

dim(mydf)        # a vector of length 2: number of rows, number of cols
nrow(mydf)       # number of rows
ncol(mydf)       # number of columns

str(mydf)        # the structure of the data frame
summary(mydf)    # gives useful info about each column
names(mydf)      # the names of the columns


```
