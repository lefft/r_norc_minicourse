### description of course

**Course Goals:** By the end of the course, I hope that everyone taking the class will have: 

- developed conceptual understanding of programming fundamentals; 
- learned practical hacking skills to make workflow more efficient and fun, and less error-prone; and
- sharpened intuitions about how to perform various operations on various datasets/spreadsheets. 


**Course Content:** We'll cover five main topics in this course:

- basics of R programming; 
- data processing and data cleaning; 
- summarizing and plotting/visualizing data for exploration; 
- using Rmarkdown to easily create nice, clean documents; and
- communicating with the web from R (w/intro to scraping if time).

We can emphasize some topics more than others, depending on everyone's interests.


**Course Format:** We'll meet once a week for four consecutive weeks. Each session will be 90min long. There will be on-screen demos and exercises throughout every session, *but* this will only work if everyone actively participates! Please bring your computer to class every week (and please make sure you have recent versions of R and R Studio installed!).
