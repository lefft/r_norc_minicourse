Get Started
You can install Slidify, write a three page slide deck and publish it to Github, all in less than 5 minutes!
  
  Step	Description	Code
0	Install	require(devtools)
install_github("slidify", "ramnathv")
install_github("slidifyLibraries", "ramnathv")
1	Load	library(slidify)
1	Author	author("mydeck")
2	Edit	Write in RMarkdown, separating slides with a blank line followed by three dashes ---.
3	Slidify	slidify("index.Rmd")
4	Publish	publish(user = "USER", repo = "REPO")
Note. You will need to create an empty repo on github and replace USER and REPO with your github username and reponame.

Step 0: Install Slidify
Slidify is not on CRAN as yet and needs to be installed from github. You can use Hadley's devtools package to accomplish this easily. You will also need slidifyLibraries which contains all external libraries required by Slidify.

library(devtools)
install_github('slidify', 'ramnathv')
install_github('slidifyLibraries', 'ramnathv')
Step 1: Author Deck
This step will create a new directory mydeck and add the necessary scaffolding. If you have git installed, it will initialize it a git repo, checkout its gh-pages branch, add and commit everything. Finally, it will open index.Rmd for you to edit.

author("mydeck")
Step 2: Edit Deck
Edit the YAML front matter (if you don't know what it is, just replace everything to the right of the : in the lines between the --- right at the top). Edit the deck, making sure to separate your slides by a blank line followed by three dashes ---.

Step 3: Generate Deck
This step generates a html slide deck from index.Rmd. It is a static file, which means that you can open it in your browser locally and it should display fine.

slidify("index.Rmd")
Step 4: Publish Deck
Now is the magical step of publishing your deck to github. You have three options: github, dropbox and rpubs

Github

Login with your github account and create a new repository. Note that Github will prompt you to add a README file, but just use the defaults so that your repo is empty. You will need to have git installed on your computer and be able to push to github using SSH

# replace USER and REPO with your username and reponame
publish(user = "USER", repo = "REPO", host = 'github')
Dropbox

publish('mydeck', host = 'dropbox')
