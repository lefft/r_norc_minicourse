#### R mini-course at NORC (hyde park office)

all materials for the mini-course will be located in this repository.

soon this readme will be something like a syllabus, with links to all the relevant stuff. 

until then, here's a description of how said stuff will be organized:

  - `course_materials/` contains slides, code, and datasets from class. contents of the `rmc_week*/` subfolders will be listed as they are populated.
  
    - `rmc_week1/` materials for the first session
  
    - `rmc_week2/` materials for the second session
  
    - `rmc_week3/` materials for the third session
  
    - `rmc_week4/` materials for the fourth session
    
  
  - `exercises/` is where you will find "homework" exercises i'll post (every week if there's demand for it). obviously this isn't school so feel free to do them or not do them. if you did an exercise and want some feedback on your code/answer, just lemme know and i'll be happy to go over it with you.

  - `readings/` is where you will find an assortment of papers that i think are valuable to read. there will be pdf's and also a text file called `links.md`, which will have -- you guessed it -- links to web-based readings.

  - `resources/` is where you'll find a collection of stuff that i have found useful for learning to code in the past. there will also be a list of links that have interesting/fun/cool/important R, computing, and data science related content.

  - `_clutter/` is where i put everything else. it's a mess and i'd recommend staying away!

  - `datasets/` contains data files that are used throughout the course. since we will sometimes use individual data files in more than one session, these are not filed into one of the `rmc_week*/` folders.
