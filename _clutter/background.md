Dear all -- 

As some of you might have heard, there is going to be a four-week mini-course on using R this spring at the Hyde Park NORC office. [[R is a programming language and computing environment designed for statistics and data analysis. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)]]

I'll be teaching the course, so I wanted to reach out to those I've heard might be interested in participating (if you are not such a person, let me know and I'll remove you from future emails!). 

Our specific agenda will depend upon: which of you will be attending; what (if any) your existing experience is with R, data analysis
 software, and programming; and -- most importantly -- what you would like to get out of the course. 

We'll start from the very basics, so if you don't have any experience with R or with programming, then this will be an ideal way for you to start learning! At the same time, if you *do* have a bunch of experience but would like to brush up your skills, learn some new techniques, get some concepts clarified, etc., then you should consider coming to (at least) the last two sessions, where we'll work through some actual examples of problems that frequently arise in social science research.

I'd like to begin the course mid-May at the latest. For that to happen, I'll need the following information from everyone who plans on attending (if you don't plan on attending, I'd appreciated knowing that too!):

1. have you ever used R? If so, for what and how extensively?
2. have you ever used commercial statistical software (e.g. Stata, SAS, SPSS)? If so, for what and how extensively?
3. have you ever learned how to use a programming language of any kind? If so, for what and how extensively?
4. why are you interested in learning how to use R/improving your R skills?
5. are there specific tasks/things that you'd like to learn how to do using R? If so, what are a couple of examples?
6. have you ever taken a statistics class? Do you use statistics or quantitative data in your daily work? 

Looking forward to hearing from yall, and please send along any questions that might come up!

p.s. If you haven't already, you should check in with Michael Reynolds about hours/charge code-related stuff for the course. 



##### survey responses 


###### br

1.  No
2.  Yes all three but I cannot claim expertise, or even intermediateness, in the slightest. Just enough to know how they function and how to figure out how to make them do something that I need, and to manage and manipulate data for tasks I need.  Basic descriptives at best when it comes to analysis.  I manipulate existing SAS case management programs almost weekly, nothing is fancy though and I’ve only ever rarely had to write code from scratch. None of my work requires it.  STATA I have been teaching myself on an as needed ad hoc basis for a project with the intent that I’ll be using it more this summer, and I do write entire rudimentary programs, again for basic initial data management as we collect from many sources. SPSS was always point and click and more analysis driven, and years ago so mostly forgotten, but technically I had 8 weeks exposure to it and wrote some quantitative analysis undergrad papers using.
3.  See number 2.
4.  Honestly I’d rather learn one of the other three more in-depth first, than intro knowledge of a 4th. At some point I need to specialize but who knows though, maybe how R does something will trigger a lightbulb with an issue I am having with SAS or STATA.
5.  SS’s don’t do much with analysis, much more with simple collection and management to then hand off for analysis. If I took anything from R, it would be simply that. Don’t need analytical statistical knowledge, except as much for staging datasets for those who wish to run their analysis.
6.  No. Learned quant. analysis with SPSS as part of undergrad major, haven’t used since. 8-9 years now. I think you’re all wrong but here I am working in it.  



###### zm

1. No
2. I’ve used SPSS for minor things. I’ve seen other journalist use it for stories. But no extensive experience.
3. No programing language skills, expect for basic SQL queries.
4. It’s a free software I can use for several stories I want to work on. I know I won’t become an expert but I feel like knowing the basics and the possibilities of R could help me develop big projects.
5. Nothing yet.
6. No


###### ns

1. I have never used R before.
2. I used SPSS in a graduate level social statistics course, and am mostly familiar with what it is capable of.
3. Never ever.
4. I’d like to become “literate” in various data analysis programs/techniques, if only to better understand how to interpret output.
5. N/A
6. I have taken one basic stats class, and do not use data in my daily role at NORC.


###### lc

1. No
2. SPSS (proficient), Mplus (proficient but not using it as often as I used to), SAS (learned this a while ago)
3. Nothing other than my answer to #2
4. Statistic assistants in my lab are primarily using R (so far) and data are processed in R 
5. Be familiar with how data are processed, how to read scripts and outputs
6. Yes and Yes!


###### sb

1.	Very little. I could recognize that commands are commands, basically.
2.	 We work extensively in SPSS, and slightly in Stata. I’ve never used SAS.
3.	Python in school. It’s been a couple of years, but I can get back up to speed when necessary.
4.	We release the GSS as R files occasionally, and get troubleshooting questions pretty often. I’d like to be able to actually fix other people’s code for the GSS in R.
5.	Nothing springs to mind – this is mostly a literacy opportunity for me
6.	Yes


###### br

1. I’ve “used” a handful of basics to begin to expose myself to R, do some R tutorials, and begin to look at data in R.
2. I’ve opened up some data in SPSS, but I had trouble finding my way around. I probably need: more familiarity with command line sort of stuff (“consoles,” “printing,” “scripts”: what produces changes where and with what sort of permanence), languages that look something like SQL, and stats.
3. I’ve now dabbled in basics for HTML, CSS, jQuery, SQL/VBA, LaTex, R (and, as a side note, in using the command line and Git), but not extensively. I’ve used HTML and CSS to build a basic webpage, SQL/VBA to get Microsoft Access to do what I needed to have done, LaTex to format a couple of documents, and R to begin looking at data.
4. R seems to promise the possibility of working with data according to characteristics of the data that have already been determined: I have a certain proclivity for working to understand what something is before I attempt to manipulate it, so a tool that allows me to act based on my understanding of what I have before me and what I want to accomplish (as opposed to pushing me into a corner where the data and I have to mistreat each other: Microsoft) seems attractive. R skills also seem fairly transferable within programming more generally, which seems like an area in which I can give in to this sort of proclivity.
5. I’d like to gain skills in data cleaning and analysis.
6. I took a stats class in high school. I’ve only brushed up against stats and quantitative data in my work so far. I would enjoy getting to take time to learn more about how to use stats.



###### ms

1. Have done a little bit of playing around with R.  Some self-teaching & use of it for sporadic specific tasks (e.g., network diagraming)
2. Have used them all.  Especially Stata – which is my “native” language for the last 20 years.
3. Way back in the day, I learned Fortran & Basic & wrote some programs.  But that was long ago.
4. I’m interested in expanding skills & having tools for specific problems.  
5. I’m especially interested in the data visualization strengths of R.  Also interested in some of the social network capabilities.  And eventually learning more about web-scraping.
6.  Yes, I took a fair amount of stat and use it regularly. ... What I found when I did use R was that I was facing a fairly steep learning curve in getting my head around some of the basic structures and commands.  It’s very much a foreign language to me, especially after having lived in Stata world for so long.  I was often trying to do things I was used to in Stata and that are built in or natural in Stata, but awkward and foreign in R – e.g., working with value labels.  My ultimate goal would be to “think” in R rather than “think” in Stata and try to make R act like Stata.


###### rg

1. Yes, in a programming course in grad school, but only enough to get the *very* fundamentals of the language & to get comfortable with R studio. After learning parallel things on both we had the choice to do our work in Python or R and I chose Python, so R knowledge = pretty limited.
2. Yes, SPSS for stats coursework in grad school; Stata for work on a recent-ish NORC project.
3. Yep, I’m most comfortable with Python…at one point was fluent enough to write own programs… though pretty rusty now since I haven’t used it much for ~3 years.
4. To help with future quant work, particularly visualization
5. Nice-lookin’ data viz!
6. Yes to stats courses (a few in grad school), no to regular quant work but yes to sporadic quant work (on a project-by-project basis…lately have been doing mostly qual, and only very simple analyses [often in excel[!!]] when doing quant…but will likely have more heavy-duty quant in future)
