<h1>Part I: Universal Truths &amp; Cycles</h1>
<p>This first part will cover some basic things that can apply to statistics, programming, and possibly well beyond. None of the following really requires any specific background or experience to understand and begin implementing.</p>
<div id="face-the-facts-and-accept-them" class="section level2">
<h2>Face the facts and accept them</h2>
<p>You have chosen to get, or have obtained, an advanced degree in a discipline that requires scientific output. Among many things, science involves putting a theory into a mathematical form that allows for some form of analytical chicanery to be applied, in an effort to weigh evidence for or against that theory. This can be very simple, and it doesn’t require causal formulation. For example, the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y = f(X) + \epsilon\]</span> may just mean something like life satistifaction (<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>) is related to some set of other things like health, education, income, (i.e. all the stuff in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>), but not exactly (<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>).</p>
<p>How you choose to investigate your theories will depend on your discipline, for better or worse. Practically speaking, it means you will have to do things like statistical analysis, collect data, do some programming, perhaps engage in a lot of writing, etc. If this isn’t for you, that’s perfectly fine, it means you’re <em>normal</em>, or at least among the vast majority of humanity. And if it isn’t your bag, it would be nice if you didn’t waste the time and resources of faculty, students, and others who do want to engagine in those activities, not to mention taxpayer money. Seriously, don’t be a jerk.</p>
<p>One more thing to plan on - everything, I mean <em>everything</em>, will take longer than you expect. That may even include your time-in-training.</p>
</div>
<div id="get-organized" class="section level2">
<h2>Get Organized</h2>
<p><img src="img/doc.jpg" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width=50%></p>
<p>The movies would like you to believe that science is just a series of eureka moments had by oddball geniuses who can’t seem to do anything right most of the time, but will intuit the perfect solution to any problem with just a moment’s reflection. As anyone who’s actually engaged in scientific research knows, this is a bunch of BS. A few simple steps can be taken, but which will avoid a lot of wasted time. There are a few things you can control in your research efforts, and this is one of them, so do it.</p>
<p>For starters, a very simple way to get organized is to create a project folder. Many IDEs (e.g. Spyder, RStudio) seem to do this now, which makes it easy. But for any project you have, make a project folder that will be the home for what you’re working on, e.g. a specific article or dissertation. This will serve as the working directory for that project<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In addition, it should have some organization to it, e.g. subfolders for data, code, documents etc. There are even R packages that <a href="http://projecttemplate.net/">do this for you</a>, but I advise you not to use someone else’s organization, as it likely will not work for you<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Note that your first attempt will also probably not work, but that’s okay, you’ll eventually find one that does the trick for most of your projects.</p>
<p>As an example, I have a batch script that will create something similar to the following folder structure:</p>
<pre class="proj_example"><code>Project/
  Data_Files/
    csvtxt/
    Other/
    RData/
  Code/
    Analysis/
    Data_Preparation/
    Descriptives/
    Functions/
    Related_Docs/
  Misc_Notes_Etc/</code></pre>
<p>Very simple and straightforward. Also, note the underscores rather than spaces. We’ll talk about naming conventions later, but the gist is that you never want to name any file or folder with a space. People tell me it’s 2017 as I write this, but somehow spaces will still screw things up sometimes, or simply must be converted to something else at some point. Sigh.</p>
<p>On the programming side, the other nice thing about projects is that whenever you open or switch to a project, all your scripts will be there just as you left them. This allows you to pick things up right where you left off. Little efficiencies gained just by being even slightly more organized can save weeks over the course of say, a dissertation. Other things we will cover, e.g. doing things in a reproducible fashion, moving from simpler things to more complex, compartmentalization, version control, etc. are all little steps in organization that go a long way towards efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="open-and-free-is-the-way-to-be" class="section level2">
<h2>Open and free is the way to be</h2>
<p><img src="img/free.jpg" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></p>
<p>The movers and shakers in the academic world generally are not using things like SPSS, MS Excel and MS Word to do their work. They are also publishing in open outlets that allow for rapid dissemination and easy access to their work. Even if their primary tools are proprietary, they’re using something open and/or free under the hood. In fact, many of the most common tools of the trade are open source and/or freely available, e.g. C++, Python, R, <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span>, Markdown, etc., and some are even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier#Boycotts">boycotting traditional outlets</a> altogether.</p>
<p>At least one reason for this is because open source means the code is available to be inspected, the licenses, for the code, if they apply, are far less restrictive<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, and often anyone could potentially contribute to the development process. This in turn produces more rapid development and extension. Furthermore, not everywhere in the world where people might want to do science is well off enough to throw thousands of dollars at software. This is why R, Python and similar rapidly gained and took over ground after decades of domination by SAS, SPSS etc.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>On the proprietary side, take for example, <span class="pack">Mplus</span>, a widely used software for structural equation modeling. They just released version 8, <em>five years</em> after version 7 and a <em>year and a half</em> since the last point release (7.4). One of the things they mentioned were ‘corrections to minor problems that have been found’. They don’t mention what the bugs were, but evidently they were allowed to exist for a year or more (we don’t know if they existed prior to that as well).</p>
<p>Other statistical software, like SPSS, have a ‘full release’ every year, but one would be hard pressed to know what’s changed over the past 10. This sort of approach to software development is not acceptable in 2017, especially when comparable or even better tools are available to do the same task<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Before I go on a rant, statistically, the best tools are found with R and Python. For writing, it’s far easier to use Rmarkdown for scientific publishing (even if you use Python), and if you really must have MS Word it will generate a <code>.docx</code> document for you. Otherwise, <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> is still quite common and will produce a much better document than MS Word, especially if using mathematical formulas, tabgles, graphics etc.</p>
<p>I’m not saying you have to go as far as Richard Stallman (the guy pictured). But you have already long used and benefitted from open source software, so all I’m saying is continue doing so in your own research.</p>
</div>
<div id="compartmentalization" class="section level2">
<h2>Compartmentalization</h2>
<p><img src="img/philipII.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width='25%' title="Philip of Macedonia is often credited with the original: divide et impera"></p>
<p>Now for a lesson from computer science, though more generally, it can be taken simply as <span class="emph">divide and conquer</span>. Break your activities into smaller, more manageable chunks. This makes it easy to pick up where you left off and get things accomplished even if you don’t have a lot of time. It has the added benefit that when things go wrong, it’s much easier to isolate the problem, and probably keep working on the other aspects of projec that are working.</p>
<div id="analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>For analysis, break activities into something like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial import and inspection: This is just making sure you’re reading the data in correctly, and that a quick glance looks like it should</li>
<li>Data processing: This is all the stuff you should be doing before you ever look at even a mean or standard deviation. Calculating composites, data debugging, merging, etc. would be included.</li>
<li>Descriptive analysis: This includes just getting a feel for the data via simple summaries.</li>
<li>Analysis: this will include trimming the data just to those variables necessary for the models, as well as running the models themselves.</li>
<li>Visualization: This can be quite an undertaking itself, even to just get one visualization just right.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="programming" class="section level3">
<h3>Programming</h3>
<p>Your code can generally follow the plan for analysis, but it can easily be even further compartmentalized. For example, scripts can be specific to one goal, however trivial. In the analysis stage, you might be investigating several outcomes of interest. I that case, have a script specific to each one.</p>
<p>One might think that having a lot of scripts would be a problem, but generally, and if you’re just starting out, the converse will be far more of an issue. You can always create a master file that will call the scripts in a desired order. I have a rule of thumb that if I get to 100 lines, I better have some justification for not breaking some of it out into a more manageable chunk<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This will also apply to functions for those that get further into programming.</p>
</div>
<div id="other" class="section level3">
<h3>Other</h3>
<p>This applies to other endeavors. For example, when writing your paper, give each section it’s own document.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="reproducibility" class="section level2">
<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
<p>Assume that at some point you’ll have to leave your analysis, code, document etc. behind. Maybe it’s just time off, maybe it’s a health issue, who knows? But think about when you come back. Will you know what you’ve done?</p>
<div id="analysis-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Analysis</h3>
</div>
<div id="programming-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Programming</h3>
<p>A starting point in your programming is to comment everything. The comments should not be about what you’re doing. This is because if you know the language at all you’ll know what it’s doing, or if you forget, it will be easy to look up what the function or command is doing.</p>
</div>
<div id="other-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Other</h3>

</div>
<div id="get-a-book" class="section level2">
<h2>Get a book</h2>
<p>If you decide on a particular analytical route for your thesis or dissertation, get a book on it. Buy it, check it out whatever you need to, but have a handy reference for the thing you’re about to spend an inordinate time on, possibly with not having ever dealt with it before. It just makes sense. Even if it’s a little more technical, remember that you’re about to spend a lot of time in this area, and that’s the sort of thing you’ll need.</p>
</div>
<div id="complexify-later" class="section level2">
<h2>Complexify later</h2>
<p>A very old approach that has withstood the test of time in many domains, start with the simple, and build in complexity as you go.</p>
</div>
<div id="much-of-your-brain-is-devoted-to-visual-processing" class="section level2">
<h2>Much of your brain is devoted to visual processing</h2>
<p>First, assume others’ brains are not so different from yours, then take advantage of it.</p>

<dt>Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow… or it can <em>crash</em>. Be water, my friend.</dt>

</div>
<div id="back-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Back up</h2>
<p>Everything. You should never lose more than a day’s work under the worst of circumstances, and if you’re doing things even with the bare modicum of responsibility, you probably won’t lose more than a few minutes.</p>
</div>
<div id="your-work-isnt-that-important" class="section level2">
<h2>Your work isn’t that important</h2>
<p>Go out and do something else. See some live music, get some exercise, go to a museum, get drunk, whatever you need to do to not think about this esoteric part of intellectual endeavor that in the end 99.9% of the world could care less about. The world will keep spinning I assure you.</p>
