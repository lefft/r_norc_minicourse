Dear all --

Thanks for your responses to the doodle poll! 

Unsurprisingly, no single time works for everyone. So I chose a handful of what seem to be the times that work for the most people. [Here is a link to a google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XNehpExAj-P-SFN1lOLrU33P9hNmaiTH5_eo3Rvvt_Q/edit?usp=sharing), where you can indicate how well each date would work for you. Instructions are on the spreadsheet too, but basically if you could give your best guess of *how many sessions you'd be able to attend for each possible time option*, that'd be great.

We'll be starting up the class either late next week (if Weds-Fri is the winner), or early the week after (if Tues is the winner). 

More soon ~~

p.s. how are yall doing with getting software installed etc.?

Dear all -- 

We'll be starting the R mini-course the week of May 15! Now we need to find a time and day that works for everyone. 

I've started a doodle poll, where you can list your availability for the first meeting: [link](https://doodle.com/poll/vxgpdv5fhtztq8rv)

There are nine of us including me, so most likely the time that we decide on won't be everyone's first choice. So please indicate that you're "available" at as many times as you can (i.e. whenever you don't have anything concrete scheduled). I've listed as possible times all times of the week that I don't have regular meetings scheduled, so there should be plenty of options. My preference would be for sometime on Friday, but we'll go with whatever time works for everyone. 

In case anyone is extra eager to get started, here is what everyone will need to have installed on their computers prior to the first session (note that if on a NORC machine, you'll need to ask TSS to put in the admin password, so put in a ticket telling them that you need the following items):

1.	a recent version of R, preferably 3.4.0. You can install it on Windows from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) (select "Download R 3.4.0 for Windows"), and on Mac from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) (select "R-3.4.0.pkg"). Just accept all the defaults during installation. 
2.	a recent version of RStudio IDE, preferably 1.0.143. You can install it from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). On Windows, choose the installer called "RStudio 1.0.143 - Windows Vista/7/8/10". On Mac, choose the installer called "RStudio 1.0.143 - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)". Again, accept all defaults during installation. 

You can use a NORC laptop or your personal machine for the class, whichever you prefer. I'd actually recommend using your own laptop if you have one, so that you don't have to put in a ticket if you realize you're missing some software in the middle of a session. If you don't have a NORC laptop or a personal laptop, don't worry -- just let me know and we will figure it out. 

In case you're extra extra eager to get started, check out [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/), an excellent tutorial system for learning R. Let me know if you have any issues getting started. 

I'll send out updates, a course outline, and other stuff periodically over the next couple of weeks, so be on the lookout for those.

Aaaand if you have any questions/issues/concerns/thoughts/ideas, please shoot me an email or just come over to my desk!

Dear all -- 

As some of you might have heard, there is going to be a four-week mini-course on using R this spring at the Hyde Park NORC office. [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) is a programming language and computing environment designed for statistics and data analysis. 

I'll be teaching the course, so I wanted to reach out to those I've heard might be interested in participating (if you are not such a person, let me know and I'll remove you from future emails!). 

Our specific agenda will depend upon: which of you will be attending; what (if any) your existing experience is with R, data analysis software, and programming; and -- most importantly -- what you would like to get out of the course. 

We'll start from the very basics, so if you don't have any experience with R or with programming, then this will be an ideal way for you to start learning! At the same time, if you *do* have a bunch of experience but would like to brush up your skills, learn some new techniques, get some concepts clarified, etc., then you should consider coming to (at least) the last two sessions, where we'll work through some actual examples of problems that frequently arise in social science research.

I'd like to begin the course mid-May at the latest. For that to happen, I'll need the following information from everyone who plans on attending (if you don't plan on attending, I'd appreciated knowing that too!):

	1. have you ever used R? If so, for what and how extensively?
	2. have you ever used commercial statistical software (e.g. Stata, SAS, SPSS)? If so, for what and how extensively?
	3. have you ever learned how to use a programming language of any kind? If so, for what and how extensively?
	4. why are you interested in learning how to use R/improving your R skills?
	5. are there specific tasks/things that you'd like to learn how to do using R? If so, what are a couple of examples?
	6. have you ever taken a statistics class? Do you use statistics or quantitative data in your daily work? 

Looking forward to hearing from yall, and please send along any questions that might come up!

p.s. If you haven't already, you should check in with Michael Reynolds about hours/charge code-related stuff for the course.
