#### R mini-course at NORC (hyde park office)

all materials for the mini-course will be located in this repository.

soon this readme will be something like a syllabus, with links to relevant stuff. 

until then, here's a description of how the stuff will be organized:

  - `course_materials/` contains notes, code, other stuff for _individual_ sessions (each session is a sub-folder). contents of the `rmc_week*/` folders will be listed as they are populated.
  
    - `rmc_week1/` materials for the first session
  
    - `rmc_week2/` materials for the second session
  
    - `rmc_week3/` materials for the third session
  
    - `rmc_week4/` materials for the fourth session
    

  - `datasets/` contains data files that we will use throughout the course. since we will use individual data files in more than one session, they are not filed into one of the `rmc_week*/` folders.
  
  - `homework/` is where you will find exercises i'll periodically post. obviously this isn't school so feel free to do them or not do them. if you did an exercise and want some feedback on your code/answer, just lemme know and i/we can go over it.

  - `_clutter/` is where i put files that might be useful but aren't central to the goal of this repo (try this strategy out -- i bet you will like).
