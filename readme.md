#### R mini-course at NORC (hyde park office)
###### tim leffel, may/2017 
<hr>

all materials for the mini-course will be located in this repository.

soon this readme will be something like a syllabus, with links to relevant stuff. 

until then, here's a description of how the stuff will be organized:

  - `course_materials/` contains notes, code, other stuff for _individual_ sessions (each session is a sub-folder). contents of the `rmc_week*/` folders will be listed as they are populated.
  
    - `rmc_week1/` materials for the first session
  
    - `rmc_week2/` materials for the second session
  
    - `rmc_week3/` materials for the third session
  
    - `rmc_week4/` materials for the fourth session
    

  - `datasets/` contains data files that we will use throughout the course. since we will use individual data files in more than one session, they are not filed into one of the `rmc_week*/` folders.
  
  - `exercises/` is where you will find "homework" exercises i'll periodically post. obviously this isn't school so feel free to do them or not do them. if you did an exercise and want some feedback on your code/answer, just lemme know and i/we can go over it.

  - `readings/` is where you will find stuff i suggest you should read. there will be pdf's and also a text file called `links.txt`, which will have -- you guessed it -- links to web-based readings.

  - `_clutter/` is where i put files that might be useful but aren't central to the goal of this repo (try this strategy out -- i bet you will like).

#### misc notes to self

- for some info/thoughts on slides from rmd source: [demo](http://data-analytics.net/cep/Schedule_files/presentations_demo.html)

- some stat teaching resources [here](http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/)

- note on 32/64 bit versions (not sent): 

	If installing on NORC machine, check whether you have 32 or 64 bit Windows via Control Panel\System and Security\System (mine is 64, so I assume everyone else's is too) before installing, because it will ask you whether you want to install 32 or 64 bit version (what this means is totally not important for our purposes, just a heads-up! If you're interested in the difference, see here). 

- nice concept from m clark book: "embracing uncertainty but avoiding relativism"

- list of things to hit from m clark's book:
	
	R, Python, Other

	IDEs; customize it; coding style

	errors as calls for help

	I/O

	basic object types; boolean; numeric of a kind; factor/categorical; data structures; vectors; matrices/arrays; data frames; indexing

	iterative programming; loops/while; aggregation

	Other; Naming things; files; variables; data; objects; Documents; Latex or markdown; Version control basics


- nice quote from [guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/mar/25/fivethirtyeight-misrepresents-climate-change-research):

- nice quote from norman nie about SPSS: 

	"It is all in the rearview mirror. “R is an absolutely massive advancement on the kind of analytics I invented,” he says. “It’s an opportunity to change the game in the fastest-growing field in software.”" [source](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0524/opinions-software-norman-nie-spss-ideas-opinions.html)
